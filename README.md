# SMMD
### Simple Multiblock Maintenance Display

## About
It's a project designed to find maintenance issues with GT multiblocks using OpenComputers mod in the ***GT: New Horizons*** Minecraft modpack
Mostly a beginner project for learning lua and stuff

Ever wanted an easy to set up program that will highlight any maintenance needs for multiblocks in GT: New Horizons?
Here comes SMMD which... Is supposed to be this but...
It's in very early stages considering this is very much a learning project

### Currently only supports 2x1 screens with Redstone I/O and manual configuration

##### Maybe It'll get useful for someone though
